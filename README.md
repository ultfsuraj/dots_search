## Dribble Search

### [Live Link](https://dots-search.vercel.app/)

#### Open in Desktop, Click on the Link above search for 'li' (20 results) or 'ee' (5 results) or empty string '' (100) results.... to check how it works on different number of results

1. switch tabs
2. click on settings
3. click on clear or search something else

(search for max 3 letters for better results, because dummy data isn't spreaded evenly)

Design issues:

1. it doesn't show what happens for large number of results (may take performance hit if cool animations are applied on large number of results)
2. for less than 6 results it kept a skeleton at the bottom
3. Didn't account for width, when both chats and lists are selected along with files and people in settings tab
